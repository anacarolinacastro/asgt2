PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The program has two functions besides the main. isAnagram and anagrams. isAnagram check if two NSStrings are anagrams. The function anagrams open the file which contains the words and copy to a array. Then the all the letters of the words of the array (wordsArray) are sorted alphabetically (for example, ‘bac’ and ‘cab’ both will be ‘abc’) to a mutable array (sortedWords). The next step is to sort the words of the new array (sortedWords2) alphabetically. The array sortedWords2 is converted to a mutable array sortedWords3. Now the program uses while to count the number that the string repeat and keep the biggest one. At the end the algorithm search for the anagrams to the string that most repeat and store them at a array (anagrams). 


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
The file path at the wordsFile open parameter have to be appointed to the file that contains the list of words. Next just run the main.m file from the project.


ANSWERS
(1) What are the words that form the largest set of anagrams given the words in the file? 
The biggest anagrams set found is (angor, argon, goran, grano, groan, nagor, Orang, orang, organ, rogan, Ronga)

(2) How long does your program take to calculate the answer in seconds? 
	2014-09-09 16:39:36.819 anagrams[4679:303] Started at: 2014-09-09 23:39:33 +0000
	2014-09-09 16:39:36.819 anagrams[4679:303] Ended at: 2014-09-09 23:39:36 +0000
So, the program takes 3 seconds to find the answer.

(3) What kind of CPU are you using?
A 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3 of memory
